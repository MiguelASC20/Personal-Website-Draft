 Hi, I'm Miguel and currently I'm attending All Star Code and I'm a rising senior soon to graduate by the summer of 2021. I've been enjoying the experience at All Star Code so far. It's very fun and very entertaining to learn something new and be surrounded with great staff who are willing to take the extra mile to see everyone one of us achieve success.

 Here you will find many interesting facts about myself and how I drive myself in my life with the experiences of not only All Star Code, but school overall and the influences that makes me continue to be the person that I am now and to be consistent with who I am.
